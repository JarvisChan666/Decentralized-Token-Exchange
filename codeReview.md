### Code Review - 6.17.2023
#### Exchange.js
Here is an in-depth review of the provided Solidity code:

Good Points:

Contract and function names are clear and descriptive
State variables have meaningful names
Extensive use of events to emit important state changes
Require statements check for important preconditions
Token contract is imported to interact with ERC20 tokens
Detailed comments explaining the code logic
Potential Improvements:

Contract could be split into smaller contracts for clarity and extensibility
DRY principle - some code is duplicated (e.g. emit Deposit/Withdraw)
FeeAccount could be an interface to make it swappable
FeePercent could have max/min values enforced
Some variable names could be more specific (e.g. _token to tokenAddress)
Interfaces could be defined for imported contracts
'order' mapping name could be more accurate
Unit tests would help ensure functionality
Code consistency could be improved (e.g. snake_case for some vars)
token amount checks could verify no overflow can occur
Error handling could be more robust
In summary, this is good, functional code with a clean structure. The main areas for improvement would be refactoring for extensibility, additional validation, error handling, and unit testing.

To improve this code for production-readiness within Apple standards, I recommend:

Extracting contracts into smaller units
Defining and using interfaces
Making V1 improvements: renaming vars, DRY principle, array opts over mappings
Adding V2 improvements: better error handling, event parameters, modifiers
Writing comprehensive unit tests
Overall, a good first pass at this smart contract! With some refactoring, additional checks and testing, it could be ready for a stable release. Let me know if you have any other questions about my review notes or recommendations for improvement. I'd be happy to discuss and provide any clarifications needed.
#### Exchange.js
6.17.2023
Here's my review of the JavaScript code:

Good points:

Thorough testing of the deposit, withdraw and order functions
Use of Chai expect assertions to validate results
Realistic flow by approving tokens before calling functions
Checks for both success and failure scenarios
Helpful variable names and comments
Well organized test file structure
Potential improvements:

Functions could be broken into smaller units for readability
Code duplication between beforeEach() functions
Magic numbers/strings could be avoided with constants
More edge case testing (invalid tokens, large amounts, zero amounts, etc)
Error handling where appropriate
Some functions are too long (> 20 lines)
Additional tests for other contract functions
Linting and formatting consistency
In summary, this is good testing code that exercises the major functions of the smart contract. It covers common success and failure paths, and uses assertions effectively. However, some opportunities for improvement exist:

Break functions into smaller units
DRY principle to avoid duplication
Define constants to replace "magic" values
Add edge case tests and error handling
Separate tests for individual functions
Linting and formatting to improve readability and consistency
To improve this code for production use within Apple standards, I would recommend:

Extracting helper functions
Using constants for tokens, amounts and error messages
Writing individual "describe" blocks for functions
Testing edge cases like zero amounts, invalid tokens and erroneous input.
Catching any failures and validating the error is thrown
Linting the code with a tool like ESLint
Applying a consistent formatting style
Overall, a good start! With some refactoring and additional edge case testing, this code could provide high confidence in the functionality and reliability of the underlying smart contract.

As always, please let me know if you have any clarifying questions or would like me to expand on any part of my review. I aim to provide constructive, actionable feedback to improve the quality of your code within our engineering culture at Apple.
